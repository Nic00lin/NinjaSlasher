Hi! This is my first game project on paygame. 
I took the game code from the YouTube channel DaFluffyPotato (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gABYM5M0ww&t=4450s) as a basis.
In this project, I tried to independently finalize this game and understand the Pygame library. To see the result, just clone the repository in your idea and run the main file.
